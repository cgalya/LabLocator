# Lab Locator

Lab Locator is a team project that is intended to solve a problem for a local hospital.  They needed a better way to tell patients where the closest labs to them are located.  This would free up administrative time and facilitate patients getting bloodwork done in a timely and efficient manner.

This app allows users to enter an address and specify a radius to search within.  The app then returns all the labs within said radius.  For each lab, detailed logistical information is presented along with a static map showing its location.  This patient-centered portion is the piece that I worked on.

There is also an administrative view that lets admins log in and edit the lab selection in the database, which for this app is Firebase.
